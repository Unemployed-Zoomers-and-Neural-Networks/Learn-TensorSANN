## About TensorSANN.

TensorSANN stands for "Tensor Super Awesome Neural Network" and is a student led **machine learning library** for the sake of learning, where we get papers and implement them into code (very badly). _(we are unemployed and have nothing better to do)_


**I don't know how you got here since the repo isn't even publicly available, but hello!**
